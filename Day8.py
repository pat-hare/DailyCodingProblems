# This interesting interview problem was asked by Google.

# A unival tree (which stands for “universal value”) is a tree where all nodes have the same value.

# Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

# Not seen unival tree before so worked through problem with solution

def count_unival_subtrees(root):
    count, _ = helper(root)
    return count

# Also returns number of unival subtrees, and whether it is itself a unival subtree.
def helper(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0, True
    left_count, is_left_unival = helper(root.left)
    right_count, is_right_unival = helper(root.right)
    total_count = left_count + right_count
    if is_left_unival and is_right_unival:
        if root.left is not None and root.value != root.left.value:
            return total_count, False
        if root.right is not None and root.value != root.right.value:
            return total_count, False
        return total_count + 1, True
    return total_count, False
